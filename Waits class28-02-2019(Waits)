Waits in Selenium
--------

In selenium there are different ways to synchronize script ,one of the frequently used option is

1. Implicitly wait()
it takes two arguments 1. Long(duration) , 2.TimeUnit (Time unit can be DAYS,HOURS,MINIUTES,SECONDS,MILISECONDS,MICROSECONDS,NANOSECONDS)
2.the Specified duration used only by findElelemnt() and findElelemnts() statements
default duration is 0 seconds

                                             Element is Present?
									
							yes                                   No                        polling period
							
				1.fE[1st matching Element]                TimeOut?                      500ms
				2.fES[All matching elements]                  
				                                             yes
														               fE[NosuchElelemt Exception]
															             fES[Empty List]
															 
control comes to any find element or any find element statement it check weather any element is present or not
if any element is present the find element return first matching element ,where as findElelemnts returns first matching element
if the specified element not present then it will check for the timeout , if the time is over findElement () method will throw 'No Such Element Exception]
where as findElelemnts returns 'EmptyList', if time is not over it waits for 500ms which is called as 'Polling Period' (present in fluentwait class)
then it will continue to check the element present or not

Exception:

TimeOut Exception : Selenium Exception (Checked Exception)


ExplicitWiat()

In Order to handle Synchronization  of any statement we can use ExplicitWiat

1. WebDriverWait is called ExplicitWait - because we have to specify waiting condition explicitly


Flow Diagram
---------------

                                     Condition is True?
									 
							yes                           No                   wait  (Polling Period)
					Next step/statement            TimeOut?                500ms
					
					                                  yes
											                TimeOut Exception
													  
	when the statement comes to waituntil statement it will check the condition , if condition is true , it will go to next statement
	if condition is false , it will check for timeout, if time is over it will throw 'TimeOutException' else it will wait for 500ms and 
	continue to check the condition
	
	using explicit wait we can handle synchronization of any statement but only one statement at a time.
	
	
	
	3.Custom Waits
	----------------
	Handling the synchronization of automation script by writing our own code is called custome wait
	eg: lap
	
	Q) write a script to check weather Login page is loaded or not within 3 Seconds ?

Note: pageload timeout is only used  by get method

  Q) what are the different ways to synchronize the script?
  1.Implicit wait
  2. Explicit Wait
  3. Thread.sleep
  4. Custome wait
  
  Q) what are the differences between Implicit wait and Explicit Wait ?
  
  
                   Implicit Wait                                  Explicit Wait
	       ---------------------------------			   --------------------------------------------
		1. We can handle synchronization  of all              1. we can handle synchronization of any method 
		findElelement and findElelements methods               but only one at a time.
		
		2.we do not specifiy waiting Condition Explicitly     2. We should Specifiy waiting condition explicitly
		 (Built-In)
		 
		3. Time unit can be DAYS,HOURS,MINIUTES,SECONDS       3. Time unit only in seconds
		MILISECONDS,MICROSECONDS,NANOSECONDS
		
		4. After the timeout we get 'Nosuch Element' Exception 4. After TimeOut we get 'TimeOutException'
		or EmptyList
		
	Q) what is the Polling period ?
	 500 mili seconds
