How do you set a value from TestNg.xml into TestMethod
- using TestNG Parameter
Example:
TestNg.xml
parameter.java
if we run above testNG class directly we get-> TestNG Exception

how do make TestNG to use default value when in parameter value is not specified
sol: by using @optional Annotation

Imp Question
1. How do you perform verification in TestNG?
Using Assert Class 
Example :
AssertDemo.java

Impoart
2.when we use Asssert it will not execute remaining Statements of current statement if comparision fails
example
AssertFail.java

To continue the execution even if comparision fails , we use soft assert which has not static method
in soft assert we Report the status we use assertAll() method at the end as shown below
SoftAsset.java

to verify basic and Critical feature we use Assert , in All the other places you use softAssert.

Important
what is the difference between asset and soft assert?

           ASSERT                                 SOFT ASSERT
1. All the methods are static                    1. All the methods are not static
2.we do not call Assert ALL                      2. we Should call AssertALL
3. it will not execute Remaining Statement       3. it will execute Remaining Statement 
of Current Test method if comaprision fails       even if comaprison fails
