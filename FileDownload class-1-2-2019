Handling FileDownload popup
------------------------------
1.we can inspect this popup
2. we cannot move this popup
3. this popup is used to download the file

solution:
we cannot handle this popup using selenium program , hence we use third party tools or classes.

In order to perform keyboard and mouse related actions we use Robot class present in java.awt package(Abstract Window ToolKit)

when we create an object of Robot class it will throw AWT Exception-CompileTimeException

Questions
Automte following Scenarios:

1.open firefox driver
2.go to download page of selenium
3.click on download link of java which will display File download popup
4.select second radio button by pressing alt+second
5.click ok by pressing enter key

to handle file download popup you will use Robot class in all the Browsers except chrome 
in chrome when we click on download link it will download the file without displaying the file download popup

Handling FileUploading Popup
-----------------------------------
1. we cannt inspect the popup
2. we can move the popup
3. this popup is displayed after clicking on browse Button /choose File Button 
and popup contains two button open and clos

Solution:
we cannot directly perform any action on File Upload popup , in order to upload the file we use SendKeys method for the upload method
in sendKeys method we must specify 'Absolute path of the File' or else we get Webdriver Exception(FilenotFound)

Exception : WebDriverException - Selenium unchecked

In order use Relative path we use File Class using which we convert it into Absolute Path
and we Absolute path as argument to the sendKey method
